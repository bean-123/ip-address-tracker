# Frontend Mentor - IP Address Tracker

This is my solution to the [IP Address Tracker challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/ip-address-tracker-I8-0yYAH0) on Frontend Mentor. The goal was to build a web app where users can input an IP address or domain and see its location and related info displayed on an interactive map.

## ðŸŒ± What I Learned

This was my first time using **Leaflet.js** and working with an external API like **IPify**. I learned how to:

- Fetch data asynchronously using `fetch()`
- Parse and update the DOM with JavaScript
- Dynamically update a map with custom markers
- Make a responsive layout that adapts to mobile screens

Hereâ€™s an example of the dynamic map update logic:
```js
const customIcon = L.icon({
  iconUrl: 'images/icon-location.svg',
  iconSize: [30, 40],
  iconAnchor: [15, 40]
});

marker = L.marker([lat, lng], { icon: customIcon }).addTo(map);
